# Edit Story Button for Arc-Powered Sites

This is a bookmarklet that you can add to your browser for convenient access to the Arc editor when you have the live article open.

## Installation

This repository is configured for The Dallas Morning News.

To add the bookmarklet to your browser, visit the [Installation Page](https://dallasnews.github.io/edit-story-button/).

## Development

To get started you'll need [node](https://nodejs.org).

Once node is installed, run `npm install` in this directory.

The main source file is `index.ts`.

Once you've made your changes there, run `npm run build`

It will give you the new minified code to paste into `docs/readme.md`
